Reject spam spammy textarea entries in Gravity Forms textarea fields.

== Description ==

Install this plugin into any WordPress system with a working Gravity Forms plugin and all matching spammy textarea submissions will be rejected and fail validation. This only checks the field type "textarea" and does not require any configuration or special settings. Its global, if its turned on, then its working.
